# 👩‍💼 Employee Help Portal – Design Project

A thoughtful initiative to support new joiners and employees on the bench in discovering job roles within the company that align with their skills and interests. This portal is designed to simplify internal hiring and enable skill-based job matching to reduce employee stress and downtime.

## 🌟 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
To build an internal job search and skill-enhancement platform for employees—especially those on the bench or newly onboarded—so they can find relevant job roles within the organization without hassle.

**Why:**  
Employees on the bench are often already under stress. This portal is designed to give them a smoother experience, helping them find roles that match their skills and guiding them on how to upskill if needed.

## 📌 How It Works (Concept)

1. The user logs in or signs up.
2. They set up a profile including skills and interests.
3. The portal recommends job roles inside the company based on this data.
4. Users can view what skills they're missing and receive suggestions to upskill via courses or certifications.
